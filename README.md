# [SoundShroud](http://soundshroud000.herokuapp.com/#/discover)

SoundShroud is my dark-mode clone of [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/discover), the popular audio streaming platform. In developing this clone, I looked to exactly replicate the core functionality of the app while reconceptualizing its color scheme to be more aesthetically pleasing.

The following technologies were used:
- React-Redux (front-end)
- Ruby on Rails (back-end)
- AJAX (front-end to back-end communication)
- PostgreSQL (database storage)
- AWS S3 (data hosting)
- Heroku (domain hosting)
